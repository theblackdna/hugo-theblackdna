Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Dan Chavez, a computer science undergraduate with a passion for full stack development. My journey in the field of computer science started back in 2014 when I had a simple [keypad mobile phone](https://mobilespecs.net/phone/photos/Cherry_Mobile/Cherry_Mobile_D13TV.html) with a character limit of a thousand and can only access few websites. I stumbled upon [XHTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/XHTML) at that time and it became my starting point as I began creating [WAP](https://ictfordevelopment.wordpress.com/what-is-a-wap-site/#:~:text=A%20WAP%20site%20is%20just,compared%20to%20their%20larger%20brothers.) sites with the help of WAP site builders that allowed me to build my sites using pre-coded widgets and minimal coding. I even created a social media site I called ActiveUnix that allowed me and my friends to exchange statuses, similar to Friendster and Facebook.

A few years later, I was gifted my first Android smartphone running on an [Android 4.4 KitKat](https://www.android.com/versions/kit-kat-4-4/). With this device, I started learning how to modify Android applications by reading and writing Smali code using tools like Apk Editor Pro, ShowJava, and ApkTool. The most notable application I have modified was [Netify VPN](https://apkbolt.com/netify-vpn-apk/), a [Psiphon VPN](https://psiphon.ca/) handler to access free internet and bypass network restrictions using configs. It was used by several local and international users and it became a turning point in my journey, leading me into join coding bootcamps and development teams.

Working with those teams allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills, and eventually, I ventured into the field of [hacking](https://www.malwarebytes.com/hacker), where I learned how to use [Google](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) to find websites with low security and bugs and exploit those using SQL injections in an attempt to access their database(s) and data.

Fast forward a few years, I am now proficient in several programming languages, have built numerous [projects](/projects/), and have experience with different content management systems and frameworks.

I am still dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills in this industry and am eager to continue my growth as a computer science professional. I am open to opportunities to further develop my expertise, feel free to [contact me](mailto:dna.chavez@outlook.com).
